<h1>Rock-Paper-Scissors</h1>
<h2>A python program for a game of rock, paper, scissors.</h2>
<h2>About The Game</h2>
<p>The game is said to have originated from China. This is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.

These shapes are "rock"(a closed fist), "paper"(a flat hand), "scissors"(a fist with index and middle finger extended to form a "V").

The game has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win, and a loss.A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.

Rock Paper Scissors is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision.</p>

<h2>Reasons For Creating This Project</h2>
<p>As part of a scholarship scheme(I4gxZuri Training) that trains aspiring web developers, we were tasked to create a game of rock, paper, scissors using python, and ensuring it runs successfully. This was aimed to ensure the students understand the use of certain functions in python programming.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learnt</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The use of random module to make a computer choose from a list of options available. The computer is giving the free will to choose whatever option it desires from a list at random.</li>
  <li>The use of choice() function to tell the computer that it's to make a choice and choose from a list of options.</li>
  <li>The use of while loop to execute a set of statements as long as its condition is True.</li>
</ul>
